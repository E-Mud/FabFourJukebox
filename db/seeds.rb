# Seed add you the ability to populate your db.
# We provide you a basic shell for interaction with the end user.

#
#   name = shell.ask("What's your name?")
#   shell.say name
#
# email     = shell.ask "Which email do you want use for logging into admin?"
# password  = shell.ask "Tell me the password to use:"

# shell.say ""

# account = Account.create(:email => email, :name => "Foo", :surname => "Bar", :password => password, :password_confirmation => password, :role => "admin")

# if account.valid?
#   shell.say "================================================================="
#   shell.say "Account has been successfully created, now you can login with:"
#   shell.say "================================================================="
#   shell.say "   email: #{email}"
#   shell.say "   password: #{password}"
#   shell.say "================================================================="
# else
#   shell.say "Sorry but some thing went wrong!"
#   shell.say ""
#   account.errors.full_messages.each { |m| shell.say "   - #{m}" }
# end

# shell.say ""
